# What is this repo?  
Clashleaders.com was created in 2016 and was hosted at www.clashleaders.com until 2024. Over the years, I maintained the website, and it grew significantly. However, I only received a handful of users each day, which made it not worth my time. In November 2014, I decided to shut down the website and make this repository public.  

# How do I run it?  
You need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) installed. You can run the app locally by executing:  
    
    $ docker-compose up web
